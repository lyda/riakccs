# Riak Cream Cheese Smearer

This is a Riak library for C that will provide a highly reliable and
performant connection to a riak cluster.  It supports multiple inserts
and balances commits across the cluster.

It is currently a work in progress.  This is an initial pass to understand
the riak protobuf api as well as the protobuf for C compiler.  A second
pass needs to work in the protobuf-c-rpc library.

# Building the code

The code is straight-forward to build. Some information on various parts.

## Configure scripts

Just to simplify things, the `configure` script is committed - you
should just be able to just build the project w/o needing autoconf tools.
However if you need to modify the build system (say you're adding a file)
you'll need the `autoconf-archives` and `check` installed as well as
all the standard autoconf tools. On ubuntu that's achieved by installing
the packages with those names.

To rebuild the autoconf scripts, just run `./autogen.sh` and pass it
any args you'd want to pass to `./configure`.

## Dependencies

On Ubuntu you'll want to install the following packages:

  * protobuf requirements: `protobuf-c-compiler` and `libprotobuf-c0-dev` .
  * code testing stuff: `splint`, `valgrind` and `lcov`.

## Special targets

See `docs/index.html` for more information on these targets. If you view
that page on your local fs (a `file:///` url) it will have links to the
generated docs and reports.

  * valgrind: Runs the tests from `make check` in valgrind to hunt for memory errors.
  * doxygen-doc: Builds cross-reference information.
  * splint: Runs splint over source.
  * coverage-html: Generate test coverage info.

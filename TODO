# Riak C library...

  * Create a logging api.
  * Allow debugging to be switched on and off with a signal or environment variable.
  * Document error states.
  * Doxygen docs.
    * Use as basis for man page(s).
    * Figure out how to group the different API calls.
  * riak_set_client_id probably needs to be changed to deal with
    connection pool.  However, is it even used?

    * -y to auto-acknowledge expensive commands.
  * Specifiy buckets and objects with a url scheme.
  * Use protobuf-c-text instead of yaml for options.
